# 🎄 🎅 🎄 Day 5: Binary Boarding 🎄 🎅 🎄

You board your plane only to discover a new problem: you dropped your boarding pass! You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.

You write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes ([your puzzle input](data/input.txt)); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.

## Part 1

Instead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means "front", B means "back", L means "left", and R means "right".

The first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.

For example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:

- Start by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.
- F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.
- B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.
- F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.
- B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.
- B keeps rows 44 through 47.
- F keeps rows 44 through 45.
- The final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.

The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.

For example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:

- Start by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.
- R means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.
- L means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.
- The final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.

So, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.

Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID 44 \* 8 + 5 = 357.

Here are some other boarding passes:

- BFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.
- FFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.
- BBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.

As a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?

## Part 2

<!-- The line is moving more quickly now, but you overhear airport security talking about how passports with invalid data are getting through. Better add some data validation, quick!

You can continue to ignore the cid field, but each other field has strict rules about what values are valid for automatic validation:

- `byr` (Birth Year) - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.
- `iyr` (Issue Year) - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.
- `eyr` (Expiration Year) - four digits; at least 2020 and at most 2030.
- `hgt` (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
- If cm, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.
- If in, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.
- `hcl` (Hair Color) - a # followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f.
- `ecl` (Eye Color) - exactly one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.
- `pid` (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.
- `cid` (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.

  Your job is to count the passports where all required fields are both present and valid according to the above rules. Here are some example values:

```
byr valid:   2002
byr invalid: 2003

hgt valid:   60in
hgt valid:   190cm
hgt invalid: 190in
hgt invalid: 190

hcl valid:   #123abc
hcl invalid: #123abz
hcl invalid: 123abc

ecl valid:   brn
ecl invalid: wat

pid valid:   000000001
pid invalid: 0123456789
```

Here are some invalid passports:

```
eyr:1972 cid:100
hcl:#18171d ecl:amb hgt:170 pid:186cm iyr:2018 byr:1926

iyr:2019
hcl:#602927 eyr:1967 hgt:170cm
ecl:grn pid:012533040 byr:1946

hcl:dab227 iyr:2012
ecl:brn hgt:182cm pid:021572410 eyr:2020 byr:1992 cid:277

hgt:59cm ecl:zzz
eyr:2038 hcl:74454a iyr:2023
pid:3556412378 byr:2007
```

Here are some valid passports:

```
pid:087499704 hgt:74in ecl:grn iyr:2012 eyr:2030 byr:1980
hcl:#623a2f

eyr:2029 ecl:blu cid:129 byr:1989
iyr:2014 pid:896056539 hcl:#a97842 hgt:165cm

hcl:#888785
hgt:164cm byr:2001 iyr:2015 cid:88
pid:545766238 ecl:hzl
eyr:2022
```

iyr:2010 hgt:158cm hcl:#b6652a ecl:blu byr:1944 eyr:2021 pid:093154719
Count the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields and valid values. Continue to treat cid as optional. In your batch file, how many passports are valid?
